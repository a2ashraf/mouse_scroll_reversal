# mouse_scroll_reversal
This script is for reversing the mouse reversal direction. I find that with trackpad I have gotten used to natural scroll on a mac, however with a mouse, i prefer the older way. This script lets you toggle very easily by simply clicking on it


After downloading the repo, just make sure you enable permissions on the .command file with this command:
chmod +x toggle_scroll_direction.command

I added an icon and if you want to add an icon to the script, right click on the .command file and go to 'get info'. On the top left you will see an image representing the file, drag and drop the icon image.jpg onto that icon in get info. This will effectively replace the icon.

Here is a demo video
